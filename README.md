# Mental Health Solution (Privacy‑First Support System)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **privacy‑preserving mental health support system** designed to identify individuals who may be experiencing severe emotional distress and provide timely, ethical assistance without violating user trust. The system focuses on early risk detection, user consent, and responsible escalation rather than surveillance or forced disclosure.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is developed for **academic and educational purposes only**. It is **not a medical diagnostic tool** and does not replace professional mental health care.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Many individuals suffering from mental health challenges hide their pain due to fear, stigma, or concern about unwanted involvement of parents or authorities. As a result, warning signs often go unnoticed until it is too late. Existing systems either ignore privacy or fail to intervene effectively.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project proposes a **user‑first, consent‑driven mental health system** that:

* Detects risk using multiple signals over time
* Respects privacy and user autonomy
* Uses human verification before escalation
* Intervenes only when there is clear evidence of imminent risk

The system is designed to "break the silence" only when necessary — and in the least intrusive way possible.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* ✅ Explicit user consent and trusted contact selection
* 📊 Multi‑source risk detection (mood reports, text sentiment, behavior patterns)
* 🧑‍⚕️ Human‑in‑the‑loop verification before escalation
* 🚦 Tiered escalation flow (in‑app support → trusted contact → emergency help)
* 🔒 Strong data privacy and encryption principles
* 🧭 Ethical, non‑judgmental user interface

---

## 🏗️ System Design (High Level)

1. **User Onboarding** – Users define consent rules and emergency preferences
2. **Monitoring Layer** – Collects self‑reports and behavioral indicators
3. **Risk Analysis** – Requires multiple independent signals over time
4. **Human Review** – Trained reviewers validate high‑risk cases
5. **Escalation** – Minimal, privacy‑respecting outreach when required

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Ethics

* No long‑term storage of raw audio/video data
* Encrypted storage of sensitive information
* User‑controlled data deletion
* Minimal disclosure during escalation
* No labeling or diagnostic language

Ethical responsibility and user dignity are core principles of this project.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Proposed)

* Frontend: Web / Mobile App (React / Flutter)
* Backend: Python / Node.js
* AI/NLP: Sentiment analysis, rule‑based risk detection
* Database: Encrypted cloud database

*(Exact implementation may vary as this is an academic prototype.)*
